troubleshooting = _(
"""<h3>Drop-outs or Xruns:</h3>

<p>Xruns are usually caused by CPU power management throttling the CPU clock
frequency too aggressively, especially if you are using a laptop.  Other
causes are using an older or slower CPU in a CPU intensive project, or
possibly (but probably not) bad audio drivers.</p>

<p>Some PCs may just be able to force the CPU
governor to "Performance" mode, others may have to disable power management
features in the BIOS.  Many laptops don't expose the ability to turn off
these features in the BIOS.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all
solution, as different generations of Intel and AMD processors use different
CPU frequency drivers and offer different power saving features and different
BIOS.</p>

<p>Others causes could be using a Jack audio device, ALSA is the preferred
back-end for MusiKernel (and does not require a special real-time
Linux kernel to achieve decent latency)</p>

<p>If you only experience Xruns immediately after starting MusiKernel, you
may want to try adding "vm.swappiness=0" to /etc/sysctl.conf and
rebooting</p>

<h3>My microphone doesn't work</h3>

<p>On some interfaces (such as the Apogee One), you may need to open the
terminal, type the command "alsamixer", and select your interface and
set the input source to something like '48v ext. mic.', and/or adjust the
microphone volume.</p>

<p>You may also need to set the number of inputs on the
"Audio In" tab of the Menu->File->HardwareSettings... dialog</p>

<h3>The UI is sluggish in a large project</h3>

<p>If using an Nvidia or AMD graphics card, you should probably try
installing the proprietary driver for you card.  In Ubuntu, with an
AMD card, for example: sudo apt-get install fglrx.</p>

<h3>The playback cursor doesn't move after pressing the play button</h3>

<p>This is <i>usually</i> caused by selecting an incorrect audio device,
such as the "default" audio device.  Ensure that you have selected the
correct device from Menu->File->HardwareSettings...</p>
